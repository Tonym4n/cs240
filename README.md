### Objective:
To analyze the sorting time performance of 3 different data structures:
- Binary trees
- Queues
- Doubly linked lists
  
Implementation:
1. Insert psuedo random values into each data structure.
2. Measure the sorting time for each data structure.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for different data structure sizes.
