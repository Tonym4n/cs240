Objectives:
  To analyze the sorting time performance of 3 different data structures:
    -binary trees
    -queues
    -doubly linked lists
  
Implementation:
  1. Insert psuedo random values into each data structure.
  2. Measured the sorting time for each sorting algorithm.
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for different data structure sizes.
